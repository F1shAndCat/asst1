OK Done.

| `VECTOR_WIDTH` | vector utilization |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| 2              | 79.0%              |
| 4              | 72.0%              |
| 8              | 68.3%              |
| 16             | 66.6%              |

Obviously the vector utilization decrease as ``VECTOR_WIDTH`` changes.

That's because that the calculating times depends on the greatest exponents in chosen vector,namely each elements will have a cost same as the greatest exponent in its vector.So when the ``VECTOR_WIDTH`` is chosen greater,more small exponent vectors will be merged in to a big one and lifts its unutilized vector lanes.

And that's exactly why the the vector utilization decrease as ``VECTOR_WIDTH`` changes.

# 3

OK Done. A double-the-sum inplementation should be fine.

this is like:

($N=8 $ and I use bars to divide the vector elements)

$0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7$

$01|23|45|67|01|23|45|67$

$\dots$

When the while ends,the vector has:

$0\dots7|0\dots7|\dots|0\dots7$
