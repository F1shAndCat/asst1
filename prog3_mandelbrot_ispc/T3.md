maximum speedup should be 8x because the vector instruction is 8-wide.

That might because transfering the float number type to the the type that  AVX2 vector instructions can process will cost time.

And Do 32*8-bits multiple itself will cost more clock cycles than Do 32 bits

mutiple.

### .1

10.9x speedup.

that is about 1.9x from 10.9x/5.72x

### .2

I determine to create 32 or 64 tasks,because the multithreading works best in 32 or 64 -threads in the first proggraming.

Actually,64 thread runs best.

And the SIMD vectorizing optimization is different from multithreadings, that is to exploit CPU's structure,rather than pipling which overcomes the speed difference between processing speed and bus speed.So the speedup will be that two optimization's mutiple.

## .3

The difference is that std::thread directly use the kernel threads,but ISPC use virtual threads.this is to say that acutally ISPC uses process to imple the thread's mission. Use process will cost more management resources but can exceed the thread limit.
